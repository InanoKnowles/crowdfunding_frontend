# UPDATES
A Guest User is someone who visits the website but does not sign up or login to an account.
I purposely removed anything that would give these kinds of users and non-owners of fundraisers, pledges and comments the ability to make updates like editing or deleting and instead put little messages to redirect for Guest Users and the functionality not available for those who are logged in.
